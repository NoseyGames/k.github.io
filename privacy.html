  <h1>Privacy Policy for “Homework Bro Bro”</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date: December 1, 2025</strong></p>
  <p>We wrote this policy to be short, honest, and easy to read.<br>
     If anything here is unclear, contact us and we’ll explain it in plain words.</p>

  <h2>1. What we collect and why</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Data we collect</th>
        <th>How we get it</th>
        <th>Why we need it</th>
        <th>How long we keep it</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Your public IP address</td>
        <td>When your browser connects</td>
        <td>Prevent abuse, enforce bans, rate-limiting</td>
        <td>7 days (server logs)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Approximate device info</td>
        <td>Browser fingerprint (no cookies)</td>
        <td>Detect bots, repeated abusers, ban evasion</td>
        <td>Only as a hashed ID</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Screen resolution & language</td>
        <td>JavaScript (<code>screen.width</code>, etc.)</td>
        <td>Same as above</td>
        <td>Only as a hashed ID</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hashed visitor identifier</td>
        <td>SHA-256 hash of (IP + device + resolution + language)</td>
        <td>Permanent ban enforcement without storing raw IP</td>
        <td>Forever (just the hash)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pages you visit & time</td>
        <td>Standard server logs + Google Analytics (anonymized)</td>
        <td>Improve the site, see which games are popular</td>
        <td>30 days (logs) / Google’s retention</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Theme preference (dark/light)</td>
        <td>LocalStorage in your browser</td>
        <td>Remember your choice</td>
        <td>Until you clear it</td>

  </table>

  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email, or any account info (there are no accounts)</li>
    <li>Exact location, GPS, or precise geolocation</li>
    <li>Any personal files or messages</li>
    <li>Data from children under 13 (the site is general audience, not directed at kids)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. The visitor hash explained</h2>
  <p>To stop people who repeatedly break the rules, we create a one-way cryptographic hash from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your IP address</li>
    <li>Browser + OS fingerprint</li>
    <li>Screen resolution</li>
    <li>Language setting</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This hash looks like: <code>a3f1e9c8b2d4...</code> (32 random characters).<br>
     Even we cannot turn it back into your IP address.<br>
     We only use it to recognize the same device if it comes back and causes problems again.<br>
     If you’re on school/public Wi-Fi, multiple people can end up with the same hash — that’s fine and expected.</p>

  <h2>3. Discord logging</h2>
  <p>When you first visit (once every 30 minutes max), we send one message to a private staff-only Discord channel containing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The hashed visitor ID (in ||spoilers|| so regular members can’t see it)</li>
    <li>Rough device description (e.g., “Windows • Chrome” or “iPhone iOS 18”)</li>
    <li>Screen resolution</li>
    <li>Timestamp and page URL</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Purpose: Let the two people who run the site quickly spot and stop spam, malware uploads, or DDoS attempts.<br>
     Only the site owner and one trusted moderator can see this channel. We never share it with anyone else.</p>

  <h2>4. Cookies & tracking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>First-party only</li>
    <li>One tiny cookie/localStorage item for dark/light mode</li>
    <li>Google Analytics (IP anonymized) — block it with uBlock Origin or any ad-blocker</li>
    <li>No marketing cookies, no Facebook pixel, no third-party trackers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Ads</h2>
  <p>We show Google AdSense ads. Google may set its own cookies and collect data according to its own privacy policy.<br>
     Opt out of personalized ads here: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a></p>

  <h2>6. Your rights (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)</h2>
  <p>Even though we store almost nothing identifiable, you still have full rights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask what (little) data we have → we’ll reply within 48 hours</li>
    <li>Ask us to delete your visitor hash (un-ban yourself or someone else)</li>
    <li>Object to any processing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Just DM us on Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/NAFw4ykZ7n" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/NAFw4ykZ7n</a> or open an issue on the GitHub repo.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The site is not directed at children under 13. If we ever learn a banned hash belongs to a child, we delete it immediately.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact & questions</h2>
  <p>Any problem, any question, any request → join <a href="https://discord.gg/NAFw4ykZ7n" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/NAFw4ykZ7n</a> and ping @owner or @mod.<br>
     We usually answer within a few hours.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>If we make a big change we’ll put a notice on the homepage for at least 30 days and update the “Effective date” at the top.</p>

  <p><strong>That’s everything.</strong> We hate creepy tracking as much as you do — we only keep the absolute minimum needed to keep the site safe and working.</p>
