# Privacy Policy for “homework bro bro”

**Effective date: December 1, 2025**

We wrote this policy to be short, honest, and easy to read.  
If anything here is unclear, contact us and we’ll explain it in plain words.

### 1. What we collect and why

| Data we collect                  | How we get it                     | Why we need it                               | How long we keep it |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Your public IP address           | When your browser connects        | Prevent abuse, enforce bans, rate-limiting   | 7 days (server logs) |
| Approximate device info         | Browser fingerprint (no cookies)  | Detect bots, repeated abusers, ban evasion   | Only as a hashed ID |
| Screen resolution & language     | JavaScript (`screen.width`, etc.) | Same as above                                | Only as a hashed ID |
| Hashed visitor identifier        | SHA-256 hash of (IP + device + resolution + language) | Permanent ban enforcement without storing raw IP | Forever (just the hash) |
| Pages you visit & time           | Standard server logs + Google Analytics (anonymized) | Improve the site, see which games are popular | 30 days (logs) / Google’s retention |
| Theme preference (dark/light)    | LocalStorage in your browser      | Remember your choice                         | Until you clear it |

We do **not** collect:
- Your name, email, or any account info (there are no accounts)
- Exact location, GPS, or precise geolocation
- Any personal files or messages
- Data from children under 13 (the site is general audience, not directed at kids)

### 2. The visitor hash explained (the thing that caused confusion before)

To stop people who repeatedly break the rules, we create a one-way cryptographic hash from:
- Your IP address
- Browser + OS fingerprint
- Screen resolution
- Language setting

This hash looks like: `a3f1e9c8b2d4...` (32 random characters).  
Even we cannot turn it back into your IP address.  
We only use it to recognize the same device if it comes back and causes problems again.  
If you’re on a school or public Wi-Fi, multiple people can end up with the same hash — that’s fine and expected.

### 3. Discord logging (yes, we do this — here’s exactly what goes there)

When you first visit (once every 30 minutes max), we send one message to a private staff-only Discord channel containing:
- The hashed visitor ID (in ||spoilers|| so regular members can’t see it)
- Rough device description (e.g., “Windows • Chrome” or “iPhone iOS 18”)
- Screen resolution
- Timestamp and page URL

Purpose: Let the two people who run the site quickly spot and stop spam, malware uploads, or DDoS attempts.  
Only the site owner and one trusted moderator can see this channel.  
We never share it with anyone else.

### 4. Cookies & tracking

- First-party only
- One tiny cookie/localStorage item for dark/light mode
- Google Analytics (IP anonymized) — you can block it with uBlock Origin or any ad-blocker
- No marketing cookies, no Facebook pixel, no third-party trackers

### 5. Ads

We show Google AdSense ads. Google may set its own cookies and collect data according to its own privacy policy. You can opt out of personalized ads here: https://adssettings.google.com

### 6. Your rights (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

Even though we store almost nothing identifiable, you still have full rights:
- Ask what (little) data we have → we’ll reply within 48 hours
- Ask us to delete your visitor hash (un-ban yourself or someone else)
- Object to any processing

Just DM us on Discord: https://discord.gg/NAFw4ykZ7n or open an issue on the GitHub repo.

### 7. Children’s privacy

The site is not directed at children under 13. If we ever learn a banned hash belongs to a child, we delete it immediately.

### 8. Contact & questions

Any problem, any question, any request → join https://discord.gg/NAFw4ykZ7n and ping @owner or @mod.  
We usually answer within a few hours.

### 9. Changes to this policy

If we make a big change we’ll put a notice on the homepage for at least 30 days and update the “Effective date” at the top.

That’s everything. We hate creepy tracking as much as you do — we only keep the absolute minimum needed to keep the site safe and working.
